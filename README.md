# WELCOME TO STREAMLIT PROJECT!


This project developed an NLP-based sentiment analysis model using Random Forest and TF-IDF to classify tweets as cyberbullying based on age, ethnicity, religion, and gender categories, achieving 93% accuracy. The dataset was processed through data cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, spell check, and vectorization using TF-IDF and Word2Vec. The model was then integrated into a GUI-based application using Streamlit to raise awareness of cyberbullying and assist in identifying patterns of harmful speech.
